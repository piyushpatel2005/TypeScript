**JavaScript that Scales**

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It includes static typing which is the main feature of TypeScript. That means it gives errors at compile time.

TypeScript compiler compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript with specification ES3 or above.

TypeScript can be downloaded using node package manager using following command.

`npm install -g typescript`

You can check various options by typing
`tsc` on command line.

You can also check the version of TypeScript compiler using:

`tsc -v`
